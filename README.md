# AmazonSales
The project consists of an analysis performed on the dataset Amazon Sale Report downloading from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data?select=Amazon+Sale+Report.csv). The dataset reports some informations about Amazon sales in India in April, May and June 2022. To view the streamlit presentation run the file 1_üè†_Homepage.py.

The project is divided mainly into three parts:

## Data Cleaning
- In this phase the df is prepared for the Visualization phase and the Modeling phase. 
## Data Visualization
- The project implements different charts:
    - Amazon Net Revenue
    - Average Monthly Order Amount 
    - Top Product Revenue by Month
    - Sales by Product Size
    - Sales Over Time 
## Modeling
- We shall make ORDER REJECTION CLASSIFICATION PREDICTION using two models based on:
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

In addition, we would like to try to find out the features that most influence this event and also we can make a comparison between Logistic Regression Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
